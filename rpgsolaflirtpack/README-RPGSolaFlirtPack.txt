SECTION I:  ////DISCLAIMER////
		

The RPG Flirt Pack seeks to do nothing more than add a bit of extra content to Weimer's excellent Solaufein Romance Mod. This was done on a whim because the NPC Flirt Packs spoiled the hell out of me and I wanted a bit more when playing the character. This is in no way meant to belittle the Romance Mod, or the original Flirt Pack idea that was started by Tsuru 5 years ago. This is just...something on the side. 

For the Original Solaufein Romance Mod, which includes all of his background information as Wes originally created it, please visit www.weidu.org. For the Original Flirt Pack Idea, please visit the Solaufein Forum at www.pocketplane.net.

SECTION II:  Installing the Pack


The RPG Solaufein Flirt Pack is meant to work with Weimer’s original romance mod for Baldur’s Gate II. There is content for both SoA and ToB and although ToB is not required to enjoy the flirt pack, I highly recommend it. There are some different aspects and subtle differences in ToB that you might enjoy shoud you decide to go to Throne of Bhaal. 

The flirt pack should install fine by doing the following:

1. Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory, which can usually be found at C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

2. Double click on "RPGSolaFlirtPack.exe". 

3. Only one language is available at this time, so the selection will be automatic

4. There is only one component, so when you are asked if you would like to install the RPG Flirt Pack, simply select Y(es), N(o), or Q(uit). 

5. To uninstall the mod, just re-run the “RPG Sola Flirt Pack.exe” and click U(ninstall)

SECTION III:  Known Bugs


There is one bug that we seem to be unable to solve at this time, and that is Weimer's original force talk option. When you first click on Solaufein to talk to him you will not receive a flirt option, you will get the option to break up with him or to not talk. Once you have this first talk, Solaufein may or may not initiate a couple of PC flirts. Meaning simply that he will flirt with the PC's options. This bug appears to sort itself out when you leave the area and there is an auto save. 
After this small problem, you should be able to flirt with Solaufein normally. If you cannot, please let me know.

SECTION IV:  Compatible Mods

Since the pack was created using WeiDU, then there should not be a problem with the use of other mods or packs. If there is, please give me a heads up on which mods you are using so I can make adjustments. In the meantime, here is a list of the mods that I know work with the Solaufein Flirt Pack. 

Make sure you have the appropriate game patch installed after the game and I recommend the G3 Fixpack right after that. For all I know, that could have been the base of all the problems as I just installed the fixpack for this testing. After those two, go for your mods. I would leave Sola last to minimize the risk of an overwrite.

SECTION V:  THANKS 

Extra special thanks goes to Weimer, who not only sparked the interest in Solaufein, but helped to redefine the Baldur’s Gate world with his creation of WeiDU. The RPG Sola Flirt Pack was written using not only WeiDU, but Near Infinity and Infinity Explorer as well.

Additionally, this flirt pack never would have come about without the interest and dedication of those people who started the idea so many years ago. Since I cannot name all of them, I will simply say thank you to them along with a special aknowledgement to those who put in the time and effort on this project.

SECTION VI:  Questions and Answers

Feedback is strongly encouraged! Most important!! If you see a flirt that too closely resembles another flirt pack I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT!!!!!! It will be removed/altered immediately as this was unintentional. Additionally, if you have a flirt that you would like to see in the pack, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT!!!!! There is always room for Jell-o, so there is always room for more flirts!

1)  	Q:  Hey! I tried flirting with Solaufein and all I get is the same old options I had in the romance! What gives!

	A:  Did ya look at the Known Bug Section above? If you didn't, then shame on you!

2)	Q.  Why don't you fix that wierd bug?

	A.  Why don't you?

3)	Q:  Solaufein isn't flirting! How long do I have to wait

	A:  He actually starts flirting rather quickly. Right around the 5th love talk.

4)	Q.  Are there new love talks?

	A.  There are no new love talks as I am not about to change Weimer's romance. 

5)	Q.  Will Solaufein still romance any gender or race regardless of current love interests?

	A.  What did I just say? This is Weimer's romance. Nothing has changed in that aspect
